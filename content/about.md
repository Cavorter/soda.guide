My name is Nathan Stohlmann and I've been enjoying sodas for most of my life and at this point have tried more soda brands and flavors than most people would have thought existed. A few years ago I started posting short reviews to Twitter and one of the most common questions I get is if I have somewhere that I'm storing those reviews so that they're easy for other people to view. The answer has always been yes, but they're in an Excel Spreadsheet which is hard for a lot of people to use for all sorts of different reasons. This site is an attempt to finally rectify that and have something that's a whole lot easier to use and reference.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Where do you find these sodas?

The simplest answer is that, as with most hobbies, the Internet is your friend. Many small soda companies are more than happy to ship you a case of their product as long as you don't mind paying ~30USD for shipping per case. (Maybe one day I'll find an inexpensive hobby...) However with the rise of the craft beer market has come an accompanying rise in the craft soda market and many cities, large and small, now have at least one retailer with at least a small selection of interesting sodas and many large cities have large specialty bottle shops where you can find just about anything.

I'm lucky enough to live in the Twin Cities in Minnesota, USA where we have two good local specialty bottle shops and lots of smaller retailers who carry small but worthy selections. For example, in my own neighborhood in Saint Paul the fantastic little corner market down the street, [Tim and Tom's Speedy Mart](https://timandtomsspeedymarket.com/), has a large selection of good sodas and elsewhere in the metro area many [Frattallone's Ace Hardware](http://frattallones.com/) locations have at least a small cooler. The big stores though are [Blue Sun Soda Shop](http://bluesunsodashop.com/) and [Minnesota's Largest Candy Store](https://www.facebook.com/MinnesotasLargestCandyStore/) which both have selections of 100's of good, interesting, and just plain weird options.

#### What is your favorite soda?

I don't have one favorite, I have _many_ favorites.

#### What about your favorite root beer?

[1919](https://www.1919rootbeer.com/) is the simple answer, but it depends on what _kind_ of root beer I'm feeling like in the moment. Do I want something sweeter and more minty like a birch beer? Do I want something with a bit more anise? There are a lot of options and I don't see a need to settle on just one.

#### Where do you stand on the Soda vs Pop debate?

I have an idiosyncratic view point in that I tend to consider Coke/Pepsi products to be "pop" and anything more interesting to be "soda". But I don't make a big deal about it. I do get a little irritated with the use of "coke" generically in the US south though.

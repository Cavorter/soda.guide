Slightly sweet. Starts with sharp natural grapefruit with medium acid but gains a fairly odd flavor in the middle that grows through the finish and persists for quite awhile. Something like powdered sugar maybe? Certainly candy-like. Would otherwise be a very nice carbonated and unsweetened grapefruit soda, but hard to get past that odd flavor. Pass.

Not sweet. A worthy attempt to straddle the line between natural and artificial but unfortunately falls into the later. Somewhat like a raspberry candy without any of the sugar. Finish is long but somewhat subtle and possibly the most authentic flavor present. Ok.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181)

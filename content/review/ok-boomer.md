Very sweet. Definitely an improvement on [a memorably bad similar soda](https://www.soda.guide/review/boots-red-hot/). Very much like liquid Red Hots candy but with a slightly better finish and slightly less fire. Early sips can sometimes show the flavor as a thinner veneer than others, but the whole is well done. Ok.

Similar to some of Real Soda's other lines, the label has a _lot_ going on. The various blocks of text are as follows:

> Back in the Day, Soda was better!

> Ironically Blue Red Hot Cinnamon Soda

> When someone says "Hey kid, how many N's in "Millennial" you say "Who cares, I got spellcheck on my phone!" and then when your phone battery goes your brain follows right behind... but that's ok!

> Refrigerate and you'll chill out & become a fan of climate change!

> Old school taste from a time when people were taught by teachers, not bloggers!

> A taste so powerful it can turn the most acquiescent into fierce street protesters... always thirsty for more, more, more!

> 12 fl.oz. (355 ml for those who insist on using the metric system!)

> This product does not contain kale or cauliflower and is the perfect alternative for those who find themselves suffering from kombucha allergies. *Not a health claim.

Some pretty mixed messaging there.

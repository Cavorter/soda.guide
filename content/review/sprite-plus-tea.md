Very sweet. Black tea flavor is immediately present along with a pleasant tang of citrus and remains remarkably consistent through the entire experience. Classic Sprite flavor is a bit more present in the middle but is otherwise very well augmented with the tea flavors for a very good ready to drink carbonated "Arnold Palmer" drink. Overall, surprisingly tasty. Recommended

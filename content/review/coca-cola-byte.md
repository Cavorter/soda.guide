I have to be honest: I did stay up late and ordered my box as soon as they went on sale. Turns out I probably didn't have to be quite so diligent. It was fun to at least feel like I was getting in early on something even if I didn't get to trying it until today. It should be noted that the packaging is great. Everything from the pixelated font to the "Player 1" and "Player 2" labels on the insert holding the cans is really well put together and it was a ton of fun opening the box. I'll have photos of the packaging in a post on my main blog soon about some of the fun packaging I've been seeing lately.

Based on all of the reviews I've been seeing I was fully expecting to be really disappointed trying this one, but right now I'm just thinking that mostly the internet is full of haters. Who I hear have to hate things? Anyway, the soda!

Very sweet. Clear and fairly rich blackberry start with just a bit of cola adding character and depth in the background. The fruit works surprisingly well with the sweetener blend and just about melds together, but just misses by a little bit. The fruit blooms a bit in the middle and trails off into a fairly pleasant long finish with just a bit of tang. Makes me really want to try a real sugar version. Ok.

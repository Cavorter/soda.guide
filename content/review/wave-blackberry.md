Slightly sweet. As usual with Wave the listed fruit flavor is mostly in the nose. Starts somewhat generically fruit-like with a subtle but detectable apple flavor that never quite goes away. Blackberry is present in the middle and fairly long end, giving a very slight tang that adds some depth. Ok.

Quite sweet. Yuzu sharpness is tempered with a hint of apple. Not having had shiso before I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for but there there is an additional herbal, somewhat peppery, layer on top I don't remember from the original yuzu flavor. Finish is surprisingly sparse given the lushness that is present in the main body, and pleasantly hangs on for quite awhile. Recommended.

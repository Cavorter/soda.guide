Very sweet. Fairly sharp citrus start adds decent, nearly natural, berry fairly quickly. The blueberry and lemon never quite meld, but coexist fairly nicely. Finish is somewhat long and fine, if a bit candy-ish. Ok.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181)

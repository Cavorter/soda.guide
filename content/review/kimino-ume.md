Slightly sweet. Slightly tart. Tastes strongly like something between an olive and a lemon with healthy wood tones in the start and extended middle. Long finish reminiscent of allspice. Ok.

The label reads:
> This sparkling water contains  
> the juice of three hand picked [Ume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus_mume) from  
> [Wakayama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakayama_Prefecture) prefecture and the water  
> from the western Japanese mountains.  
> Made in Japan  
> Made for you

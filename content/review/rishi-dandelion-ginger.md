Not sweet. Natural ginger suffused with complex bitter and earthy flavors present a challenge to anyone who read the label text and expected something different from the use of the term "ginger beer". The bitterness, which I suspect is from the dandelion root, is very present but also not overpowering. More like a slightly over-steeped black tea than coffee or an IPA. Medium fire lingers a bit longer than expected and is apparently capsaicin boosted with chili peppers according to the ingredients. The essence of some citrus flavors flit through the very long finish. Recommended.

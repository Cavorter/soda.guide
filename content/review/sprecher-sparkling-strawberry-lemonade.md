Very sweet. Pretty sharp start that is more lemon by feel than by flavor. Quick transition to pretty natural strawberry in the middle with a substantial bloom. Lemon finally shows up some in the medium-long finish, though still dominated by the berry. Ok.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181)

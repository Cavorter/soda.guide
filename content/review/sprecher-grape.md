Very sweet. Somewhat tangy and very "purple" start with some echos of natural grape juice hidden among the classic grape soda flavors. Almost finishes cleanly but has a very long, mild end. Recommended.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181).

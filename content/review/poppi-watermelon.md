Medium sweet. I always have trouble with "watermelon" flavored sodas. They hardly ever taste anything like any actual watermelon I've ever had. This particular example is a bit more perfumey than most along with the more typical melon-like flavors that I associate with this category of flavor. All of it blends really nicely with the light vinegar base that is a bit more obvious here than it has been with the other Poppi flavors. I'm pretty torn on the rating for this as it's actually really good, but calling it "watermelon" is where I get lost. Recommended.

One last note: this is another of the Poppi cans where it is nearly impossible to read the majority of the text. Bright white on bright lime is not enough contrast to be discernable!

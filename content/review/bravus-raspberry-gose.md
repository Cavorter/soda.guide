Medium sweet. Where the sweetness in the Oatmeal Dark was kind of off-putting, in this Raspberry Gose it makes a lot more sense. Also there is just enough of a tartness to bring down the perceived sweetness to something much more expected from something that also has plenty of fruit going on. Speaking of which, plenty of nice raspberry flavor here that works really well and kind of sits on top of the malt base that was also unsatisfying in the Oatmeal Dark. The fairly long finish is a little tart, a little fruit, and a little malt but overall not unpleasant. I suppose a good summary might be that this is nearly everything that the Oatmeal Dark was not. Fairly nice really. Ok.

Quite sweet. Initially starts exactly as labelled, somewhat uncannily. The sweetener blend pokes out in a few places but provide interest and context for the rest of the experience instead of being distracting. Fade to the finish is steep to a murmur of minimal flavors that hang around for awhile. In some ways it feels like you start from a typical grape soda and see a series of mutations into something somewhat different, and possibly better. Really, very good. Recommended.

Medium sweet. I was pretty skeptical about this flavor working with the vinegar base [after trying their cola](/review/poppi-classic-cola), but I'm pleasantly surprised at the result. Starts a little sweet and then adds just a little bit of tartness from the vinegar before a lovely herbal spice comes through with lots of vanilla. The finish is nearly short, but a very slightly sour presence remains for awhile longer. Nicely different. Highly recommended.

Medium sweet. Fruity start with tinted natural orange followed by some light tannins. A small swell of bitterness rises in the middle and threatens to overwhelm before fading with the extended herbal finish. Lots of complexity is revealed while savored. Between the packaging and the contents they come pretty close to a fairly successful shelf-stable version of a refined drink that you wouldn't be ashamed to order in a hipster bar somewhere.

Medium sweet. An initial burst of flavor has both tea and cranberry melted around a lightly tannic core with faint hints of ginger emerging through the finish. Just enough cranberry in the start to give a little pucker. The finish can come off a bit like sweetarts candy, which is a little disappointing but mostly fine. Ok.

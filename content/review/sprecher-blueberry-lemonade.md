Very sweet. Acidity and light tang from a pretty classic lemonade are mostly subsumed by blueberry flavor that might just be on the wrong side of the uncanny valley. Hard to tell if that's from the added flavors or possibly an interaction with the preservatives. I want to like it a lot, but it just keeps on not being quite what I hope it would be. Maybe just toning down the sweetness would bring it more in focus? Ok.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181).

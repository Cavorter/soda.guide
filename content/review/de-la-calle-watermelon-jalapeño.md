Quite sweet. The fermentation does change some of the flavor characteristics you would expect for a can with Watermelon and Jalapeño on the label, but the watermelon is the one that undergoes the majority of the transformation. Where the pepper retains just a touch of it's heat and most of it's grassy flavors, the watermelon mostly lends sweetness and something like a softened version of the rind. There are flavors here that I suspect quite a few Americans would regard as "off", and I'm not entirely sure they're wrong, but it is nice to be challenged sometimes. Ok.

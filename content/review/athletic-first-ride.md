Slight sweet. The coffee hits hard and strong, but with enough sweetness to blunt the bitterness. Probably closer to an espresso than drip. Reasonable depth from some malt integrates really well. Compares really well to RTD cold brew coffees, but with a slightly different flavor profile. Recommended.

Very sweet. The label proudly announces that this beverage "Fights Scurvy!", but unfortunately does not also warn that it fights taste buds just as well and it is not above fighting dirty. Orange, guarana, wintergreen, clove, anise, and vanilla make for exceedingly unruly shipmates from terrible start to exceedingly long and truly unpleasant finish. Hard pass.

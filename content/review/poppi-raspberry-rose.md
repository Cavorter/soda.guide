Medium sweet. Strong, fresh raspberry start with just enough tartness. Similar to the [Strawbery Lemon](../poppi-strawberry-lemon) flavor, I suspect the pleasant pucker is coming from the vinegar instead of the fruit but here it is much more successful and extremely well integrated. Floral notes arrive eventually if you look for them and, thankfully, do not overpower like some rose water concoctions tend to do. It's very subtle but adds a nice depth to the very extended, but very pleasant, finish. Recommended.

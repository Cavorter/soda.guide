Quite sweet. More cranberry than I was expecting in the start with nearly a pucker. Can't quite put my finger on the "winter spice" that does show up towards the middle. Maybe allspice? It's certainly present between the classic lemon-lime that continues to be fairly tart. Pretty typical long Sprite finish. An interesting concept, and might be worth a look for those who want to see Sprite's usually ultra-sweetness tempered. Ok.

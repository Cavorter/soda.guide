Quite sweet. Sharp natural ginger start joins with an interestingly tart fruit flavor that isn't quite like anything I've tried before. Something like a less-sweet tamarind? Hints of bitterness around the edges add to the herbal depth of an already complicated brew. Fruit diminishes quickly in the moderately long finish that continues to feature ginger. Quite delightful. Recommended.

Very sweet. This soda should be named "BUTTERSCOTCH!" instead of aluding to any kind of caramel as the only flavor profile you get from the start to the lingering, slightly unsatisfiying, finish is just that: rich butterscotch with possibly a hint of candy rum flavor. Comes across as both complicated and also really simple at the same time. Ok.

Quite sweet. Smoke starts very quickly with a little tartness underneath the fairly omnipresent sweet. A bit of fire from the capcaisin starts creeping in the middle and slowly builds as you work through the can. The flavor is hard to pin down specifically, but I would say that roasted pineapple is the core with some accompanying spices I can't quite identify, but appreciate. Very round mouthfeel. Recommended.

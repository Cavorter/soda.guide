Quite sweet. Some fruit in the nose. The start is a blast of lightly tart candy peach tempered with a touch of vanilla. The flavors fall out slightly with the sweetener blend in the middle before combining mostly successfully for the very long finish. Overall more like a peach flavored gummy candy than may have been intended. Ok.

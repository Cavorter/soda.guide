Very sweet. Fresh strawberry works pretty well with the lemonade base, blunting the acidity a bit. Fruit really blooms in the middle before getting lost in a fairly muddled medium-length finish. Ok.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181).

Quite sweet. Simple cola without a lot of frills. Many of the big brands try to add a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg, but this has just enough of the astringency of the base kola with a crystal clear cane sugar surface to present a pure ideal of the form. More likely to be interesting to the Pepsi side of the divide than Coke, but worth looking for both sides. Recommended.

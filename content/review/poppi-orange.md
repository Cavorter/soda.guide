Slightly sweet. Could be carbonated orange juice and, other than some notes from the sweetener blend and the lack of pulp, it could be at least slightly difficult to tell the difference blind. Sort of an amazing achievement. I'm not sure if that is better commentary about modern juice flavor packs or the engineering behind this soda, mostly likely both. Absolutely worth trying. Recommended.

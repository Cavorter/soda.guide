Very sweet. Coconut aroma erupts from the bottle and permeates the entire experience, strongly reminding me of sunscreen in the 1980's. Somewhat sharp pineapple with an underlying bitterness starts firm but mellows quickly to a nearly buttery middle before transforming again to a more typical Mountain Dew finish, albeit one suffused with coconut. Ok.

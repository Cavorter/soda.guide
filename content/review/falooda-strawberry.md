Medium sweet. Fruit start over cream with matching texture. Plenty of people are turned off by the more chunky textures in a drink like this, but the basil seeds are not overwhelmingly present with a good assortment of jellies to keep things interesting. The strawberry is about as natural as a McDonald's shake, which isn't a terrible thing, but not what I could call entirely natural either. Definitely a better than usual example of this sort of drink and worth trying for the curious. Ok.

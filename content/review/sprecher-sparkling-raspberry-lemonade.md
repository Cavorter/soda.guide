Very sweet. It's interesting to contrast this against [the non-sparkling version](review/sprecher-raspberry-lemonade) that I reviewed earlier today. The start is considerably more sharp, featuring the lemon quite a bit more with the raspberry much less prominent throughout. The candy tones present in the still version is also much less prominent in the the sparkling version which makes the whole experience quite a bit better. Ok.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181)

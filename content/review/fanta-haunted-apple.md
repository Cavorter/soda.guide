Very Sweet. Somewhat cloying cinnamon and allspice dominate the start eventually giving way to some apple flavor eventually. The middle never gives a chance for anything other than "scented candle"-like flavors that mostly end up being kind of a cohesive muddle of not great. Finish is medium length and mostly inoffensive. Pass.

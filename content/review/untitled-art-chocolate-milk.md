Quite sweet. It has been a really long time since I have had actual chocolate milk but despite that there is definite correspondence with that fading memory, even down texture somewhat. It is sweet for a near beer but the title is enough cover that I don't mind it. Still, anyone looking for something that isn't a pastry stout should definitely look elsewhere. Nice balance of cocoa and a cream-like tone pairs well with a soft carbonation. The finish is almost solid milk chocolate melting through a long finish. Ok.

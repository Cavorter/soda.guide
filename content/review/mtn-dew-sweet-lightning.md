I honestly haven't been to a KFC in at least 10 years, and probably longer than that, however on the occasion of the release of the Beyond 
Nuggets at our local KFC it was a good excuse to pop in. (Worth mentioning, The nuggets are quite good.) Between that and not watching the Mtn Dew scene very closely I was a little surprised to see this option in the soda fountain. That surprise was slightly tempered when I remembered that KFC is another PepsiCo subsidiary and they seem pretty excited to make sure each of their properties has at least one custom Mtn Dew flavor.

Very sweet. Very strong peach, though not overpowering. No trace of honey discernable. Right up till the classic Moutain Dew finish it's really a fairly decent peach soda. Ok.

Purchased from [KFC Roseville, MN](https://locations.kfc.com/mn/roseville/2087-north-snelling

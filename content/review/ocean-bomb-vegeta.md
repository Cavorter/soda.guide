Very sweet. The label says "vanilla", but that's not what I'm tasting. Fairly acidic, almost citrus-like but never really resolves into much beyond "sweet". Maybe "vaguely flavored" is the best description? I suspect the use of the word vanilla on the labelling should have been "plain". Finish is candy-like and lingers a maybe a touch too long. Ok.

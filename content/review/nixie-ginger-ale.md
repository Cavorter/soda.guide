Medium sweet. Slight fire. Fresh ginger nose presages a lightly sweetened fresh ginger flavor. Some notes of lime bloom in the middle. As with the other [Nixie](/brands/nixie) sodas, the sweetener maintains a slightly odd hollowness to the entire presentation, though less so in the case and overall it is much closer to working here than with at least one of the other examples. Finish is very long and drifts toward citrus. Probably one of the better "diet" ginger sodas I've tried. Ok.

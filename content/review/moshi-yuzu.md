Quite sweet. Bright and accurate citrus explodes from the start, ripens in the middle, and lingers exceedingly pleasantly in the extended finish. Very slightly tart, but not enough for a true pucker. Lightly acidic enough for the hint of an edge. Fragrant nose. Over all just pretty much stunningly good. Highly Recommended.

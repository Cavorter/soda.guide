Medium sweet. Herbal start over a citrus base resolves to mostly juniper with some floral notes to take some of the edges off of a slightly bitter lime core. From the branding and can text it seems clear this is intended as a canned high end gin and tonic adjacent mocktail, and the depth pays off in spades. Lime finish is very long and worth savoring. Recommended.

**NOTE:** This review is an early item I found in my old Twitter stream that counts as a soda review. It isn't actually very useful and is in reference to an entire line of sodas that no longer exists (White Rock Organics) but I wanted to include it for posterity.

In case the tweet is ever deleted, it reads:
> Some flavors are not necessarily "good", but they are certainly "nostalgic". Foxon Park Lemon-Lime soda is _definitely_ nostalgic.

Very sweet. Surprisingly bitter start with mostly classic Mountain Dew citrus predominant. Subsequent sips reveals the peach in the middle to usually long end. The flavors never quite combine and seem to be in opposition with each other most of the time. That said, it's not particularly bad either? Ok.

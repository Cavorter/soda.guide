Medium sweet. A pretty good example of the difference between true citrus and aloysia citrodora. Where a typical lemonade or lemon-lime soda would be more clearly single noted and acidic, this has some subtle herbal depth that rounds out the flavor profile of an otherwise understated soda. Lovely finish. Recommended

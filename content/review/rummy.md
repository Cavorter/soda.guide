Very sweet. From the label I had been expecting something closer to Ting or Squirt but the actual flavor contains a lot more lemon/lime than grapefruit. Very round, but not quite syrupy, mouthfeel. I think the most accurate description might be "Sprite + Grapefruit" and the addition does add quite a bit to the sum. Relatively clean finish with some lingering grapefruit essence. Ok.

Medium sweet. Picture in your mind the classic grape soda: Nehi, Buddy's, Boots, Fanta, whatever. Now, imagine there is a dial on the bottle (because of course it's in a glass bottle) that is currently set to 11 out of 10. Turn that dial down to a 4 or 5 and you get this. The classic grape flavor is still there but it comes across as both lush and comforting. The sweetness is present but not pushy. The finish lingering but not overstaying. Pretty amazing. Recommended.

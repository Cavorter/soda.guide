Medium sweet. A surprisingly dry take on a fruit flavor like peach. The initial sweetness evaporates quickly leaving the floral fruit behind for a really long finish. Strongly reminiscent of a really good [bellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellini_(cocktail)) I had many years ago. Recommended.

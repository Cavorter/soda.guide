Very sweet. Sharp and deep yuzu start. Peach barely peeks through in the middle before giving a marginally better showing in the finish, but this is mostly a yuzu show from start to extended finish. Somewhat disappointed there wasn't more peach so it's hard to recommend this over their original yuzu flavor, but might have enough extra flavors for some people. Still, can't go wrong with either so far. Pretty amazing. Recommended.

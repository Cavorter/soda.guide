**NOTE:** This review is an early item I found in my old Twitter stream that counts as a soda review. It is not in the more useful later form of review but I am including it for posterity.

In case these tweets are ever deleted, they read:
> Today's lunch soda: Girlan Pink Birch Beer

> Girlan Pink Birch Beer: Seems to be a birch beer/cream soda hybrid. Definitely "sugar bomb" class. Not bad, but won't get more.

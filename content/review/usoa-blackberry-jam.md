Medium sweet. I am conflicted. Unlike the [Sour Blueberry](../usoa-sour-blueberry) this one is much closer to the flavor of the natural fruit. At the same time it's also kind of a generic "berry" flavor. It would be nice if I had another can of the blueberry so I could do a blind tasting because I'm really not sure I could tell the difference unprompted. That little bit of extra flavor though does bump this past "fine" to decent. Ok.

Slightly sweet. Mango featured at the start. Floral orange comes in quickly, light and bright around the mango core, eventually blending nicely. Chili shows up in the finish and starts nearly undetectable but by a quarter of the way through the can becomes a firm but pleasant presence. Recommended.

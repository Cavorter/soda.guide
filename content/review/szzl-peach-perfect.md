Medium sweet. Somewhat complicated start with the almost natural fruit nearly overpowered by a somewhat woody tea flavor. The fruit briefly wins out in the middle before the tea returns for a bow in the finish. The flavors never quite meld through the whole experience but don't fight either. Fairly short and almost clean finish. Interesting. Ok.

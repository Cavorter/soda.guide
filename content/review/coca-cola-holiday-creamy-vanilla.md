Very sweet. Stronger than usual cola bitterness at the start over strong vanilla tones. The vanilla fades in the middle but lightly resurfaces later over mostly classic coke finish. Hard to identify the "holiday" portion of this without directly comparing it to the existing Vanilla Coke flavor. Possibly more nutmeg? It does seem different from memory, but not by much. Ok.

Medium sweet. I really don't mean this to be too negative, and I will grant that it has been probably a couple of decades since I've had what I'm about to compare this to, but in a lot of ways this is pretty much carbonated Tang. I always enjoyed Tang so that isn't a bad thing in my book but it is difficult to not make the comparison. The place where the flavor deviates is in the finish where the nectarine comes through and lasts for quite awhile. Ok.

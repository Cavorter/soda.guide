Very sweet. Starts with sharp lemon and pretty quickly gains nice raspberry. The sweetener blend appears fairly quickly afterward, seeping in slowly at first and eventually resolving to an ever present candy presence in the mouth. The main flavors fade fairly quickly in the finish, but the sweetener blend lingers. The usual trademark Mountain Dew finish was noticeably absent, which may be better or worse for different people. Ok.

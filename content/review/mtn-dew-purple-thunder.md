Currently in limited release to Circle K and affiliated stores in North America.

Very sweet. Possibly the best color for a soda I've ever seen. It's this really lovely jewel-toned blue shading just a bit into purple. Really gorgeous. Strong berry start establishes itself well, blooms nicely in the middle, and catches a hint of the classic citrus Dew just before the long berry finish. Kind of shockingly good considering the branding. Recommended.

Purchased from [Holiday Station Store #372](http://www.holidaystationstores.com/locations/Detail?storeNumber=372)

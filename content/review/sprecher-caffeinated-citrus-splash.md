Very sweet. Fairly straightforward non-specific citrus soda. Somewhere between 7-Up and Mountain Dew in tones and notes with a very slight, and not unwelcome, bitter undertone. Start might have more lemon while the very long and slightly sticky finish might have more grapefruit. Ok.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181).

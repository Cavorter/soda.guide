Quite sweet. The flavor is best described as a fairly classic banana pudding. While absolutely not the texture of a pudding, it does still feel round and soft in the mouth. The start comes across as exceptionally rich, thinning slightly in the middle, but filling out again for a medium long finish. Quite remarkable. Recommended.

[Tip: Try it in a float with either chocolate or vanilla ice cream!](https://www.cavort.org/posts/2022-06-15-float-notes/)

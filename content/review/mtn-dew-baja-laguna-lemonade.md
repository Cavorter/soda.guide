Very sweet. Fairly good artificial mango flavor explodes from the bottle when opened and is absolutely the most prominent flavor throughout. The very full fruit nearly eclipses the bright hint of lemon that arrives just before the start of the overly long classic Mountain Dew finish. Reasonably good for a short lived variant. Ok.

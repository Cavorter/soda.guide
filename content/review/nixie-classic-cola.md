Very sweet. Except when it's only slightly sweet? I've had similar experiences with stevia sweetened sodas previously, but this one is a particuarly dramatic example of the type. The start is abrupt and intense with some well defined cola, but nearly instantly that intensity evaporates. What is left feels a bit like there is a hole in the middle of one's mouth and the flavors all end up around the edges, but not on the top of the tongue. A bit of acid and vanilla do add some character to the otherwise pretty odd experience, but not enough to make it worth trying. Pass.

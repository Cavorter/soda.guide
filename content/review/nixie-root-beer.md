Very sweet. If you have read the [Nixie Cola review](nixie-classic-cola), some of this is going to sound pretty familiar, but I think this one is generally better executed. The initial taste is intense and very sweet, but nearly instantly hollows out. However in this case a good wintergreen remains present enough through the middle to provide a solid core for other nuances to show in the exceedingly long finish. There vanilla and clove make a welcome presence over the gradually fading wintergreen and make for a pretty decent effect. Definitely not my favorite root beer, but diet soda drinkers should absolutely give this one a try. Ok.

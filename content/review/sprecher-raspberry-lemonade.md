Very sweet. Pretty good blend of lemon and raspberry turns out to probably be the best of the four varieties in this line. Somewhat sharp but not quite tart, and certainly not sour. The raspberry is most prominent in the middle, with lemon start and end. The whole thing has a bit of a candy-like sweetness that detracts from the overall experience and pretty much cancels out any of the decent natural flavors that are clearly present. Ok.

Medium sweet. Nicely off-dry where a good portion of the sweetness is provided by the flavor rather than actual sugars. Light ginger manages to accentuate tannins from the tea while the elderberry provides some fruit and floral complexity on top but unfortunately never quite manages to blend between the two layers. Ok.

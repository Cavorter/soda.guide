Medium sweet. Superficially I can see why they call this cranberry but I find it lacking in the character of the real fruit, though no more than the usual way so many artificial and "natural" fruit flavors only vaguely resemble the real thing. That said, it is a nice cranberry-adjacent berry flavor and even more pleasant that it is not overwhelmed by the sugar. Finish is very long but inoffensive. Simple. Ok.

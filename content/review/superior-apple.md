I had been trying to figure out something more to say about this one, because it really is as simple as the review that follows this so I went looking for more info about Superior Craft Elixirs. I've quite liked their line of switchels and knew they were part of [Sociable Cider Werks](https://sociablecider.com/) but figured it was worth looking for more. Short digression, this year I have really gotten interested in women's hockey, particularly the PWHL though I now also have season tickets for the University of Minnesota Gophers. So it was a strange confirmation of my feeling lately that "everything is hockey" when I found out that the founder of Superior played hockey for St Olaf College back in the early 2010s. Anyway, enough digressional padding. On to the review:

Quite sweet. It is very good apple juice that happens to be carbonated. Recommended.

Very sweet. Strongly aromatic nose that is non-specifically "fruit". A bit like walking into a bulk candy store. Not terrible start, almost entirely artificial strawberry with hints and surmises of other flavors. The sweetener mix which includes sugar, apple juice, sucralose, and AceK is largely successful. The long finish is kind of pleasant though mostly inoffensive. Ok.

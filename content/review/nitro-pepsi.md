*Note*: Before trying either of the Nitro Pepsi flavors it is worth reading through [some notes on my other blog](https://www.cavort.org/posts/2022-04-08-pepsi-nitro-notes).

Very sweet. Fantastic foam, not quite as great fluid. Classic sharp cola with a much softer bubble make for a decent soda, though for some reason the plain cola flavor comes across as a LOT more sweet than [the vanilla variety](/review/nitro-pepsi-vanilla). It seems pretty clear to me that extra sweetness is at least partially to blame for the more pronounceably flat affect. Still, the wonderful foam at the start is nearly worth getting through the rest of it. Heck, if they could increase the viscosity just enough to trap that foam for longer I suspect this would be an amazing success. Ok.

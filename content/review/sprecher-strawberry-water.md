Slightly sweet. That's not entirely accurate, but it gives the impression of sweetness enough to come across as sweet even without any sweeteners present. Related, could be accurately described as what you would get if you had removed all of the sweeteners from [their line of strawberry sodas](../sprecher-strawberry). Tart and candy notes are still present along with something like a real fruit essence but without any of the honey in the soda. Ok.

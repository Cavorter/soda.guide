Medium sweet. Nicely tangy start. The non-specific citrus is featured right away with a touch of lime bitterness. Long time readers will be familiar with my comparison of some citrus sodas to floor cleaner, and unfortunately that comparison is more apt than usual since this one comes with a fairly strong chlorine flavor and odor. I poured some into a wide mouth glass to sit for a bit. If it is actual chlorine than the pour and access to circulating air should cause the chemical to evaporate. After waiting 5 minutes it was already noticeably reduced. After 10 minutes it was drinkable. After an hour the chlorine was gone but also flat. I did leave a voicemail with the company this morning to see if they had any comment about this, but this doesn't make me super excited about the other flavor I have in the queue. Pass.

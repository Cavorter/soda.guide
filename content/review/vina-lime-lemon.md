Medium sweet. I have a terrible time calling this by it's name since every other soda like it has the fruits in the other order. Lovely citrus start, predominantly lime, works nicely with the vinegar for a sharp acidity without being too strong. Finish does come off a bit floor cleaner-ish but works pretty well. At some point the finish transitions to slightly woody that could be nicer. Ok.

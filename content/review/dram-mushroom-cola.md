Slightly sweet. Interesting start is certainly cola-like but resolves to nutmeg, cinnamon and a little orange oil. Maintains the slightly alkaline sub-tone of a classic cola just enough to maintain the illusion without having any of the actual nut in the ingredient list. The flavors are subtle, but present and never watery. Unclear what the mushrooms bring to the party other than possibly a little umami in the inoffensive finish. Ok.

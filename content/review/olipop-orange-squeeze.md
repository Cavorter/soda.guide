Quite sweet. Welcome to the uncanny valley between "orange pop" and "orange juice". Orange blossom-like fragrance makes for a juicy start married in the middle to mild citrus tang with tones more common to a carton marked "not from concentrate". Medium length finish is distinctly reminicent of San Pellegrino. The sweetener blend nearly melds with the whole lot but ends up floating over it all. Ok.

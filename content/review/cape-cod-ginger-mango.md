Medium sweet. Some beverages really straddle the line between juice, soda, or whatever and this is a perfectly good example. It would be easy to categorize this with [their competitor down the coast](/brands/bruce-cost) but this comes across less as a soda than as a juice, justifying the label of "ginger beverage". Raw ginger is very prominent in the start, though with little fire. Natural mango layers in shortly after the start, though a more tart version then you might expect. The whole thing comes together with that medium tartness melding both flavors with just a little lift from a really clean sugar profile. Nicely balanced. Recommended.

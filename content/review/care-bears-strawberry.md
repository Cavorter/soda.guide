Not sweet. It is interesting to note that the label lists both My Private Label and Ginseng UP, which gives some idea where some of their formulations are being sourced. Just opening the bottle releases very fragrant artificial strawberry, with the actual flavor a pretty close match. Stays fragrant in the mouth all the way through the extended finish and has a few different tones that appear at different times including pepper, musk, and dill. Ok.

Quite Sweet. Nearly overwhelming wintergreen from start to finish. Right after the start a distintly birch sourness provides a lot of depth and counterpoint to the usual root beer sugar. The maple _is_ present, but mostly hinted in the extremely long finish. It's almost unfortunate that the wintergreen is so strong because there is clearly plenty going on below the surface but it's hard to find against a veritable wall of mint. Ok

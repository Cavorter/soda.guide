Very sweet. While present, the usual wintergreen and other flavors from the root beer are quite muted and hard to discern over the fairly strong vanilla flavors along with a little bit of burnt sugar and caramel. More caramel into the medium length finish. Fairly nice as a vanilla cream soda. Dissappointing as a root beer. Ok.

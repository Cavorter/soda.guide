Very sweet. Fruitcake? Yankee Candle? Extropianism? So far those are my best guesses for what "Futuristic Flavored" tastes like. The Coke Creations line tends toward love it or hate it, and unfortunately I'm pretty firmly in the later camp on this one. The scent is odd. The flavor is more odd. The finish is long and not particularly good. Pass.

Very sweet. Tangy fruit start that is somewhere between classic artificial and natural flavors, enough that I can believe this was near a real version of the named fruit somewhere in it's lineage despite the label unusually declaring only artificial flavors being present. The fruit trends toward candy-ish in the middle and then settles back towards natural fruit in the medium-long but relatively clean finish. I'm not sure where the titular "creamy" was supposed to enter, but it never appears. Ok.

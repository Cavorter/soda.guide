Very sweet. I can see what they were going for, I just don't think they got there. Near the finish you catch a solid glimpse of the classic orange soda base but everything prior to that is kind of a muddled mess. There are flashes of peach and flashes of orange but mostly it comes across as fruit-like sweetness rather than anything else. Ok.

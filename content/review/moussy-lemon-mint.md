Quite sweet. Intense start with both tart lemon and a big hit of spearmint that runs through the entire experience. The malt from the na beer base does make brief appearances just before the extended, and quite minty, finish but is mostly providing a little character in the background rather than being anything like prominent. Unexpectedly soda-like for a malt beverage. Ok.

Medium sweet. Fruit and basil start has a little bit of white pepper. The fruit is pretty close to natural, though more like the huge and slightly bland strawberries from the grocery store than the intensely flavored wild varieties. In a lot of ways that's kind of how the soda is flavored: laid back and not intense. The flavors are very present but speak without shouting. Very long, remarkably clean, but also mild finish. Berry inflected basil just kind of lingers nicely until it suddenly doesn't. I'm fairly certain this is the perfect soda for someone, but I don't think that person is me. Ok.

Very sweet. Somewhat generic tropical fruit start has definite guava and at least one or two other flavors that I can't quite identify. The cola does show up in the middle just a little but never rises past background status. The most pleasant part is definitely the finish where the fruit slowly fades to a slightly toasty late finish that is kind of special. If only the rest of it had been as good. Ok.

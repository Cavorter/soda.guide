Very Sweet. Candy-like start quickly develops depths of wintergreen and molasses along with other ephemera. The candy start returns near the end and haunts the extended finish. Definitely a different flavor profile from their standard root beer. Ok.

Purchased at the [Saint Paul Midway Menard's](https://www.menards.com/main/storeDetails.html?store=3181).

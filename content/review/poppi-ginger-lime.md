Medium sweet. I debated quite a bit before deciding on medium for the sweetness. On first sip the lime is very prominent, and strong enough to come across as artificial despite all of the packaging and website text protests to the contrary. I could find the ginger if I looked for it, as it mostly is expressed by a nice, slightly woody tone in the back of the mouth. But the rest of the flavor profile was more elusive. Stevia was pretty likely, though it and sucralose taste fairly similar to me so I like to check the ingredients to be sure. Given the label text is white printed on bright light green it was impossible for me to read so I had to resort to [their website](https://www.drinkpoppi.com/products/ginger-lime/). There was clearly another sweetener involved but it was really surprising to see that this includes apple cider vinegar. Having tried quite a few sour beers, kombuchas, switchels, and other drinking vinegars it was suddenly obvious but with almost all of the edge removed. This is definitely not what someone would normally associate with a vinegar based soft drink. Overall quite an interesting soda. Might work well in an ice cream float. Ok.

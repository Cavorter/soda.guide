Very sweet. Fruity start with a tiny bit of a cola backbone. I suspect that most people will be pretty confused by that fruit start given the prominent "Marshmallow" branding, but it is properly labelled that the _collaborating artist_ is Marshmallow and the actual flavor is intended as watermelon, strawberry, and cola. The strawberry is probably the most clearly defined flavor but you have to catch it at the right moment. Outside those somewhat rare moments it's a lot more like a decent fruit punch than anything recognizably Coke. To be honest, if I didn't know this was supposed to have cola I don't know that I would identify it. Medium length finish is pretty much a jumble like the rest of it. Ok.

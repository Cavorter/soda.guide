*Note*: Before trying either of the Nitro Pepsi flavors it is worth reading through [some notes on my other blog](https://www.cavort.org/posts/2022-04-08-pepsi-nitro-notes).

Very sweet. Cola start has a just enough vanilla to be noticeable but isn't overpowered. The foam is absolutely the best part, consume as much of that as possible. It is delightfully creamy and has a lovely flavor. The soda itself is probably going to be considered by many to be "flat", but the nitrogen bubbles are definitely present, just much more subtle than the CO2 bubbles most people are used to and expect. Really lovely and I'm hoping they keep this in the long term. Recommended.

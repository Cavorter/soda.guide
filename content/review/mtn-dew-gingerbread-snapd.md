Very sweet. Fascinating nose. A waft smells like typical Mountain Dew while a sniff smells like gingerbread. The flavor has a similar dichotomy with a clear, and fairly decent, gingerbread cookie flavor followed with the classic Mountain Dew finish. Altogether somewhat unexpected, certainly an odd combination, and not unsuccessful. Ok.

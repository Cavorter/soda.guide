**NOTE:** This review is an early item I found in my old Twitter stream that counts as a soda review. It is not in the more useful later form of review but I am including it for posterity.

> Saranac 1888 Ginger Beer: Soft feel, nicely sweet, good ginger but no fire. Excellent oak smokey finish. Recommended.

> On the Saranac Ginger Beer: Might qualify more as a Soda or Ale, rather then Ginger Beer. Not enough fire but really strong ginger flavor.

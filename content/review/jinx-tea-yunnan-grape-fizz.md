Slightly sweet. Interesting start with a strong echo of a classic grape soda flavor that morphs on the tongue into a complex blend of lightly tart floral and tea flavors. Ultimately not specifically fruity, but does have some lovely tannic structure from the tea. Remarkably short and somewhat subtle finish. Highly Recommended

Quite sweet. Fairly unambiguous natural grapefruit flavor from start to finish. Pretty much like a nicely carbonated bottle of Ocean Spray with a little bit of extra sugar that manages to add rather than detract from the fruit. I'm a little torn about the rating but I think it needs a bit more complexity or depth to be really amazing. Ok.

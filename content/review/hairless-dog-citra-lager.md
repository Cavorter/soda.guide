[Something Bowl Sunday 1/5](https://www.cavort.org/posts/2022-02-13-something-bowl-sunday/)

Slightly sweet. Overpowering hops nearly obliterates everything else though some malt comes through eventually. IPA lovers looking for a non-alcoholic beer might enjoy this but far too hoppy for something labelled a "lager". Pass.

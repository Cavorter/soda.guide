Slightly sweet. Brilliantly combined flavor profile leaves doubt if the sharpness is coming from the luscious and prominent fresh raspberry or the more subtle but still obviously present vinegar. Either way, the start is an enjoyable fruit stiletto that opens to layers of tartness through the relatively clean medium finish. Recommended.

Medium sweet. The grapefruit and apple cider vinegar are **so** close to working well together. The start is moderately sharp but appropriate with really nice grapefruit up front and prominent. That sharpness though is two toned which ends up being distracting rather than giving depth. The middle has some nice esters from the peel that actually compliment the stevia flavors that start to come through. Moderate finish has a touch more stevia than I would like, but is inoffensive. This was so close to being amazing. Ok.

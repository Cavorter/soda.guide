Slightly sweet. The start is very classic root beer with a really heavy wintergreen flavor but immediately starts to change. The sweetness lets off and becomes fairly tangy. Not quite sour, but maybe just a touch of pucker. As quickly as the pucker arrives it drifts away into a really long, and fairly pleasant, wintergreen finish. Vanilla is quite strong in the nose but never quite makes an appearance on the tongue. Definitely different. Ok.

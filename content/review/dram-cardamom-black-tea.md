Slightly sweet. Immediate cardamom on the nose and the tongue gets subtle support from some tannic tea and a little umami sneaking in out of seemingly nowhere. Fascinating mix of flavors that works surprisingly well starts simple but gains complexity through the middle and well into the finish. Never gets strong but stays well away from watery. Recommended

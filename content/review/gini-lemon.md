Quite sweet. Classic sweet lemon-lime start quickly develops a bitter spine from the quinine that complements but never joins the fruit. The middle is mostly the same slowly fading into the incredibly long finish wiyh the bitter tones lingering the longest. Pretty nicely done if you like tonic water, but that will color appreciation. Ok.

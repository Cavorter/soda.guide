Quite sweet. Surprisingly sweet for a near beer. If it had been a fruit beer I could maybe understand, but this is supposed to be something like an Oatmeal Stout and it shouldn't be just about as sugary as a standard soda. There is some bitterness there to take the edge off the sugar, and gives some toasty notes. Those toasty notes go along with a kind of rich but odd cereal flavor that is really the major feature. It's not horrible, but not something I'd recommend to anyone either. Pass.

Very sweet. Opening the bottle fills the air with the scent of red fruit. The raspberry is very apparant before even taking a taste, but the "spice" component is essentially missing from the nose until you get close to the liquid. The start is fruit tinged cola with much more prominent clove and cinnamon. Clove persists through the middle but fades fairly quickly before the end. Finish is very long, syrupy, and not great. I'm not sure if it's the fruit or the spice flavors, but they seem to jumble and never quite resolve to something nice. Ok.

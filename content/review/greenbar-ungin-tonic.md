**NOTE**: Chill thoroughly before opening the can. All of the room temperature cans I have opened have gushed significantly.

Medium sweet. In order of appearance, there is a flash of juniper followed by a tang of quinine that is then overwhelmed by an unfortunately floor-cleaner-ish lime, all surrounding a somewhat bitter core. In spite of itself, I do mostly like it, but the flavors fight more than blend and the citrus in particular is just loud without saying anything. Disappointing. Ok.

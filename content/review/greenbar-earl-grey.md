**NOTE**: Chill thoroughly before opening the can. All of the room temperature cans I have opened have gushed significantly.

Slightly sweet. Fragrant bergamot, clove, nutmeg and some other more elusive spices emphasize a lovely tea base. For a carbonated beverage the mouthfeel is remarkably soft and lush. Spice mix remains strong through the middle and clove-heavy medium finish adding some resiny tones along the way. Pretty distinct from a standard RTD tea and I think is pretty successful at positioning itself by both flavor and packaging as something kind of special. Recommended.

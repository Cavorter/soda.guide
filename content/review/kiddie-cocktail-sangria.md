Very sweet. I'm generally a big fan of sangria in it's many forms. It varies so much depending on so many factors it can be hard to pin down what specifically makes a good sangria, but to me it has to start with good wine and good fruit. So far it's been rare to get a really good example in a soda, but [it has happened](../senorial-sangria). Based on the other Kiddie Cocktails soda from Blue Sun I had some hope that this one might be pretty decent, but it didn't quite meet that bar. It's definitely a modified grape soda, which could be a decent start, but that misses the point of starting with wine in a normal sangria by ignoring all of the characteristics that fermenting grape juice brings. Mostly this just ends up tasting like candy, in particular a purple Smarties candy. It's fine if you're looking for extra sweet grape soda with only a little extra candy sugar flavoring for depth, but is pretty disappointing for something called sangria. Ok.

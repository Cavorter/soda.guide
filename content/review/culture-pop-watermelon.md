Medium sweet. While I am able to find the watermelon and rosemary when I look for it, the flavor is predominantly a nice light citrus variety that carries hints and echoes of the sought for melon and rosemary that surface more often near the finish than at any other time. I think if either of the other titular flavors had been more prominent this would have been a clear recommended, but it's fine. Ok.

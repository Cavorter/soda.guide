Very sweet. Candied slightly-generic berry flavor is pretty straight forward and unambiguious. Has just a touch of depth in the middle with a hint of black pepper. Narrowly avoids being syrupy but also steers well clear of any semblence of actual fruit. Surprisingly good and relatively short finish. Very close to being great but ends up just: Ok.

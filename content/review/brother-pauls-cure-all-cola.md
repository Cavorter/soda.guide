Sugarbomb. Nice herbal aromatics in the nose are immediately blasted away by the overwhelming sweetness. A wash of candy-like flavors thoroughly smother the hints of cola, cinnamon, caramel, and all-spice that are clearly in the base. Finish is somewhere between nice cola and acrid baby-aspirin. Some real potential, but squandered by just too much candy. Pass

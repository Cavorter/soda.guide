Very sweet. More fruit than cola from start to finish. The mango sits somewhere in the uncanny valley: Nearly authentic, but artificial enough to be occasionally jarring. The cola is present if you search for it carefully, but overall is more like a lost opportunity for a much more interesting soda. Ok.

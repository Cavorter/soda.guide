Quite sweet. Starts out like a classic lemon-lime soda but changes after a beat with a very particularly lightly bitter herbal flavor that is immediately recognizable as turmeric. The lemon-lime base stays present throughout with different flavors appearing and disappearing through the middle and finish. The honeybush doesn't really come through until the finish, and more as a tone high in the mouth that works well with the fading turmeric. Not entirely sure it completely works, but definitely worth a try for those looking for something different. Ok.

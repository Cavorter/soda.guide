Quite sweet. I keep on going back and forth between calling this a twist on a classic lemon-lime soda, and being somewhat disappointed by the lack of blend with the stevia. Closer to Mountain Dew than to Sprite, just as a point of comparison. Starts somewhat sharp but gets flattened by the sweetener. Finish is okay but runs a bit long. Ok.

Very sweet. I sometimes get some of the most interesting things from the Try the World snack boxes, and this one is no exception. Apparently the Yugoslavians wanted something like Coca-Cola before it was allowed to be imported into the country and came up with their own domestic attempt flavored with dog rose hip (Rosa Canina). The start is close to a classic cola but never quite gets there, instead gaining a kind of sweet-tart overtone with a little extra tang that provides some nice depth starting in the middle. Medium long finish is never quite clean and slightly bitter, but fairly pleasant. Ok.

Slightly sweet. Rich and malty with just enough hops to provide a bitter backdrop without being overwhelming. Excellent mouthfeel. Probably one of the better alcohol removed beers that I've run into lately. While many have a certain tang in the finish, this maintains a full flavor all through the extended finish. Recommended.

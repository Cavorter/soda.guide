Slightly sweet. IPA fans might be disappointed, but as someone who doesn't appreciate too much bitterness this is a pleasant surpirse considering it does have that designation on the front label. Beer fans looking for something without a buzz though should consider a look. Sweeter than some might like, but well balanced overall with light fruit along with hops and malt. Has some belgian tones, though clearly not brewed in that style. Recommended

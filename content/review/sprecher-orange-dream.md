Quite sweet. Classic baby aspirin/orange cream flavor right out of the bottle. Good vanilla and good fruit. Eventually develops a pronounced and nearly off-putting level of bitterness, though arguably adds depth at the same time. Honey is just barely discernable if you go looking for it, but could use a touch more. Ok.

Very sweet. Surprisingly, a very good example of a classic orange soda. Checking the packaging, the white label provider appears to be [My Private Label](https://myprivatelabelbeverages.com/) who pretty clearly know how to make a good soda. Clean orange flavor from start to medium long finish. Good cane sugar ensures that finish is pretty clean. Surprisingly good for something that I was expecting to be sold primarily for the [Garbage Pail Kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_Pail_Kids) branding and nothing else. Recommended.

Purchased at [FYE Maplewood Mall](https://www.fye.com/)

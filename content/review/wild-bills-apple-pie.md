Very sweet. Interstingly strong allspice in the start is joined late by apple toward the middle. The flavor swings between "nicely herbed fruit" and "overly scented candle" and never quite settles into one or the other. Cinnamon is present but could possibly use a touch more. Long finish is pleasantly fruity. Ok

Very sweet. Most of the things I said in [the review of the sugared variety](../coke-starlight) applies here. I think the artificial sweetener blend might work slightly better. The "subtle cooling sensation" feels slightly less out of place among the inherently artificial NutraSweet and AceK flavors. Ok.

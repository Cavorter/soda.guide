Slightly sweet. Plenty of blueberry in the nose. Flavor is more fructose than fruit. There is fruit there, but not something really specific on the tongue. It's nearly all in the nose. Medium long finish finally shows some really lovely natural fruit in the moments before it trails off. Ok.

Purchased from [Wave Soda](https://wavesoda.com/)

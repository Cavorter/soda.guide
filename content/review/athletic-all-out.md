[Something Bowl Sunday 4/5](https://www.cavort.org/posts/2022-02-13-something-bowl-sunday/)

Not sweet. Roasted malts are the star and they do shine pretty well. Slightly toasted bitter edge brings character and adds to the depth. A little more thin that I normally like my stouts, but works ok here. Not perfect, but worth it. Recommended.

Very sweet. Labelled as a passionfruit, orange, and guava flavored soda I can see what they were going for and in the usual way they are not subtle about their flavors. I won't swear by this since it has been at least a couple of decades since I've tasted it, but from what I remember this is at least strongly reminiscent of Juicy Fruit gum. Or possibly one of the many "Tutti Fruity" ice cream flavors or gumballs I remember from the 80's. In that way it is definitely a nostalgic flavor, and by that same token not something I would think of as particularly natural. It's a bit hard to describe in some ways. Almost minty while retaining some fruit-like essence that is hard to pin down. Ok.

A note about the label, it doesn't show very well in the photo but the tropical foliage on the label is done with a really lovely foil effect. I believe they used a similar printing style with their recent Minnesota Birch Beer flavor ([which sadly has cherry listed as an ingredient](/about/#why-dont-you-review-any-cherry-flavored-drinks)) so maybe fun foil labels are in store for more of their limited run flavors this year.

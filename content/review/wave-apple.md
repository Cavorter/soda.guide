Slightly sweet. Interesting trying this flavor in the context of the Blackberry flavor earlier today, where the apple tones that were distracting there really come into their own here, and you can see how they got there from here. Fruit first start has cider and floral apple notes with a pleasant light tartness. The fruit runs through the middle and extended finish mostly unchanged, though with a little bloom in the middle. Recommended.

Very sweet. Even from the scent you can tell they went hard on the butter flavor and taking a sip brings that sharply into focus. The peach comes through under a blanket of the butter eventually, maybe not muffled, but certainly well wrapped. Probably one of the better implementations of artificial butter flavor in a soda that I've run across. It feels like it's missing spices. When I have real peach cobbler I expect nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and possibly all-spice but this is just butter and peach. Ok.

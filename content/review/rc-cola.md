Quite sweet. The also-ran of The Great Cola Wars, I've always thought of RC as under rated in comparison to the big two. It has a lot of the flavor characteristics of Coke Classic with little hints of cinnamon and all spice, while also maintaining the sharper cola flavor of Pepsi, all while coming across as less sweet than either even though the actual sugar content is right in the middle with 34mg per 12oz to Pepsi's 30mg and Coke Classic's 39mg. The somewhat lingering finish is all cola. The real trick these days is even finding it. I don't think I've seen any RC in the inner metro for at least 15 and possibly 25 years. Glimpsing a stack of 12 can cases while picking up something way out in Andover the other week was kind of shocking and an instant review target. Recommended.

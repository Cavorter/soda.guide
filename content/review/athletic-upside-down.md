[Something Bowl Sunday 5/5](https://www.cavort.org/posts/2022-02-13-something-bowl-sunday/)

Not sweet. Like the Hairless Dog Lager earlier today this is hop forward. The difference then is in degree, not kind. Where the Hairless Dog used a big hammer, Athletic instead adds enough to be assertive but not enough to be abrasive. Floral notes develop in the middle and the finish is like dry honey. Recommended.

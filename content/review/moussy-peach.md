Quite sweet. Identifiably peach, but with some slightly interesting overtones. The malt base is _just_ detectable but overall pretty subtle. The start is quite fruit forward but somewhere right in the middle you aren't quite sure if there is maybe some spearmint in the mix. That slightly minty tone grows a little into the medium length fruity finish. Ok.

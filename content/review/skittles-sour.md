Very sweet. In the long tradition of lime flavored drinks the smell has a lot in common with floor cleaners, though not in the best sense here. The flavor has a concept of the plan of sour, but never actually gets there. Not even really tart. Comes off as sort of an odd lime and apple combination which is not terrible. Not a fan of the finish, but it's not offensive either. Pass

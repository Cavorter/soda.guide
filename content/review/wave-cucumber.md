Medium sweet. If this had been labelled an apple soda I would have said it was pretty good. As a cucumber soda however, it's a mixed bag. The start is pure apple with a little bit of cucumber shadow. The cucumber shows a bit more in the middle but then fades away before the long apple finish. I think if you label a flavor this distinctly, you need to follow through and they really didn't here. Just added a bit of underwhelming cucumber to their quite good apple base does not make for a "Cucumber Soda". Ok.

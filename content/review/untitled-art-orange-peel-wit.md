Medium sweet. A surprising amount of natural orange in the nose. More hops than I was expecting at the start adds a bitter core with a soft wheat shell. The flavors feel layered but cohesive through the entirety, including the medium long finish. Nice complexity though the fruit might be off-putting for some. Ok.

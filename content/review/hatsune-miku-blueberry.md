Very sweet, though bordering on Sugarbomb. So much more floral than I was expecting. The flavor is an odd, but not unpleasant, mix between natural apple, lychee, and artifical blueberry. Hits strongly floral at the start, moving through the fruits in the middle and end, then resolving into a lightly floral very long finish. Ok.

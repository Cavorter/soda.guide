Medium sweet. Starts more tartly than the usual lemon-lime soda, more like a good lemonade. The actual lemon flavor holds through the middle until some lime flavor and bitterness finally come through at the beginning of the finish. Medium long finish has slightly cardboard-y grapefruit flavors, just enough to distract but not enough to ruin. Nicely different. Ok.

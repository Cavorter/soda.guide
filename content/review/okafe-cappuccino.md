I should start with a disclaimer: I am NOT a coffee drinker. I try a sip or two occasionally but find it to be far too bitter. The only exception was on a vacation in Guatemala where it was served with lots of milk and an extremely light roast of very fresh beans from a farm on the other end of the valley. I was like nothing I have ever tried before or since.

Medium sweet. Definitely coffee (Probably a medium or dark roast?) with enough dairy and sugar (15g in 8oz) to blunt the bitterness in the start and middle but as they fade pretty classic bitterness rises to the fore and sits through the very, very, very long cocoa tinged finish. Ok.
